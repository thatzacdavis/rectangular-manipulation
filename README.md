# Rectangular Manipulation

The `Rectangular Manipulation` app allows users to draw, move, resize and change the color of rectangles on a canvas.

It automatically stores every change automatically to `localStorage` in the browser.

Currently it does not change transformations properly.

It is statically hosted [here](https://rect-man.surge.sh) via [Surge](https://surge.sh/).
